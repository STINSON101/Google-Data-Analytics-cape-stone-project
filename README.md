# Introduction
Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! In this case study, I will perform many real-world tasks of a junior
data analyst. I will work for a fictional company, Cyclistic, and meet different characters and team members. In order to
answer the key business questions, I have to follow the steps of the data analysis process: **ask, prepare, process, analyze,
share, and act**.

# Scenario
I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,
my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,
my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives
must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations.

# About the company
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, program has featured more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.

# Ask
**Three questions will guide the future marketing program:**

2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

**Guiding questions:**

1. What is the problem you are trying to solve?
2. How can your insights drive business decisions?

**Key tasks:**

1. Identify the business task
2. Consider key stakeholders
   
**Deliverable:**

A clear statement of the business task

# Prepare
I will use Cyclistic’s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends. Downloaded the previous 12 months of Cyclistic trip data
using this [link.](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) The data has been made available by
Motivate International Inc. under this [licence.](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement)

**Guiding questions**

**1.Where is your data located?**

The data is located in my device and downloaded from (https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).

**2.How is the data organized?**

seperated into 12 Each month in its own csv file, each file contains 13 columns (ride_id, rideable_type, started_at,	ended_at,	start_station_name,	start_station_id,	end_station_name,	end_station_id,	start_lat,	start_lng,	end_lat,	end_lng,	member_casual) 


**3.Are there issues with bias or credibility in this data ROCCC?**

There is no bias because the data set represents cyclists, but there is some loss in the names of the stations. Is this due to the lack of sufficient signage or another reason that we will see during the analysis

**4.How are you addressing licensing, privacy, security, and accessibility?**

According to the company, it owns a license to the dataset. In addition, the data contains personal information about the riders

**5.How did you verify the data’s integrity?**

All the files have consistent columns and each column has the correct type of data.

**6.How does it help you answer your question?**

It have some key insights about the riders and their riding style and type

**7.Are there any problems with the data?**

You are missing some information such as the name of the stations so It would be good to have some updated information about the bike station

# PROCESS
For this project I am going to use Jupyter notebook to combine all the datasets into one dataset and perform data cleaning and manipulation.

# ANALYZE

# SHARE
